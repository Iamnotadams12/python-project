## Project Overview

In this project, we explore various COVID-19 datasets to extract meaningful information. The analysis includes:

- Daily case counts
- Vaccination rates
- Trends over time
- Geographic distributions

By utilizing libraries like NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, we aim to present data in a clear and engaging manner.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iamnotadams12/python-project.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd python-project
```

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will load the dataset and generate visualizations that summarize the findings.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the code comments within the scripts.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Easily load various COVID-19 datasets.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Visualization**: Create charts and graphs to represent data clearly.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform basic statistical analysis to uncover trends.
